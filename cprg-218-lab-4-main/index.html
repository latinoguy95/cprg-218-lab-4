    <div class="panel">
      <p>Born in Ecuador, but lived most of his life in Cali-Colombia, Juan Tovar emigrated from Colombia to Calgary, AB (Canada) for seeking better opportunities and to study a career that allowed him to perform as a journalist (after earning a Bachelor's in Journalism back in Colombia). Seeing coffee as an opportunity to bring his Latin heritage to Canada, Juan started to research about the availabilty of Colombian coffee in Calgary overall and he realized he could create something that would appeal both Colombians (and Latinos overall) and Canadians to make them feel that magical and surreal experience only Colombian coffee could bring.</p>

    <button class="accordion-btn">About our Coffee Harvesters</button> 
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Everything starts with our Coffee harversters, who from the Coffeelands (Northern Valle del Cauca, the Departments of Quindio, Risaralda, Caldas, West Tolima and Huila, and Southern Antioquia) get the Coffee Cherry. Coffee is actually made out of the seeds of this fruit, which is roasted next and grinded, and finally ready for consumption. We value the efforts of all the Colombian Coffee harvesters, without their hard labor, commitment and sacrifice, Juan Tovar Coffee wouldn't be possible.</p>
